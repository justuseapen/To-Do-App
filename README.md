# TODO App on Ember
###By Justus Daniel Eapen Jr.

+ This is a simple To-Do list application designed to satisfy the Johns Hopkins coding challenge.
+ I built the app using a ember.js, following the todomvc tutorial.
+ Normally, my platform of choice is a Ruby on Rails backend with a front-end framework (like Zurb Foundation).
+ I chose to use ember for this coding challenge because the requirements were so simple that building the app in Rails would have taught me nothing I didn't already know. I wanted to take this as an opportunity to learn something new, and ember was the perfect candidate.
